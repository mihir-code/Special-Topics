        Using sophisiticated calculus, we'll be able to provide an answer to a question asked by billions all over the world.
    </h1>
    <p>
        We take inputs like the number of people, consistency of rice, cups of water, etc to provide you, the Customer, 
        with the exact amount of rice necessary. According to a global report <b>900 million tonnes of food</b> is thrown away every single year.
    
        <pre><br>That's insane.</br> </pre>
       
        In that massive amount of waste, rice makes up a massive part of it. Just in the Phillipines, <b> 308,000 tons</b> is wasted each
        year. The food waste problem also affects the world's battle against climate change. The wasted rice in Asia alone emits <b>610.5 million tonnes</b>
        of CO<sub>2</sub> a year! 

    <br> While that's insane, I unfortunately cannot do much to stop that. However, I can start the change with my family. 
    We love rice and eat it around 3-4 times a week. I've recently started to measure the rice myself and notice that a lot of the food gets wasted based on 
bad math. To solve this problem, I've come up with the innovative solution, RICER, to solve my family's problem indefinitely.</br>
